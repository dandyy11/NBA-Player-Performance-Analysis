## Descriptive Analysis

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("E:/Baylor Material/STA 5V85 - Capstone/Analysis 1/all_seasons.csv")

# Basic summary of the dataset
summary(data)

# Average age, height, and weight
cat("Average Age: ", mean(data$age), "\n")
cat("Average Height: ", mean(data$player_height), "\n")
cat("Average Weight: ", mean(data$player_weight), "\n")

# Distribution of players by team and country
cat("Top 5 Teams by Player Count:\n")
print(sort(table(data$team_abbreviation), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5])

cat("Top 5 Countries by Player Count:\n")
print(sort(table(data$country), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5])

# Average points, rebounds, and assists per game
cat("Average Points Per Game: ", mean(data$pts), "\n")
cat("Average Rebounds Per Game: ", mean(data$reb), "\n")
cat("Average Assists Per Game: ", mean(data$ast), "\n")

```

## Diagnostic Analysis

```r
# Assuming data is already loaded and 'ggplot2' is available

# Points, Rebounds, and Assists vs. Age
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, y=pts)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red") + ggtitle("Points vs. Age")
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, y=reb)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(method="lm", color="green") + ggtitle("Rebounds vs. Age")
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, y=ast)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue") + ggtitle("Assists vs. Age")

# Rebounds vs. Player Height
ggplot(data, aes(x=player_height, y=reb)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(method="lm", color="orange") + ggtitle("Rebounds vs. Player Height")

```

## Predictive Analysis

```r
# Load necessary libraries
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("e1071")

library(caret)
library(e1071)

# Assuming data is already loaded

# Prepare the data
set.seed(42)
index <- createDataPartition(data$pts, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
train <- data[index,]
test <- data[-index,]

# Linear regression model
model <- lm(pts ~ age + player_height + player_weight, data=train)

# Model summary
summary(model)

# Predictions
predictions <- predict(model, test)

# Calculate RMSE
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - test$pts)^2))
cat("RMSE: ", rmse, "\n")
